**Beta Status:** Valdi has been widely used in Snap's production apps for the last 8 years. We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.
**Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity.** Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges.
## Quick Example
A basic Valdi component:
```
import { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  onRender() {
    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';
    <view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}>
      <label color='black' value={message} />
    </view>;
  }
}
```

## Why Choose Valdi?
Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.
### True Native Performance
Unlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:
  * **Automatic view recycling** - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency
  * **Optimized component rendering** - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates
  * **Optimized layout engine** - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead
  * **Viewport-aware rendering** - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default


Learn more in our Performance Optimization Guide.
### Developer Experience Built for Speed
Valdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:
  * **Instant hot reload** - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling
  * **Full VSCode debugging** - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode
  * **Familiar syntax** - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety


### Flexible Adoption Model
Valdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:
  * **Embed Valdi in native** - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies
  * **Embed native in Valdi** - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via `<custom-view>`
  * **Polyglot modules** - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript
  * **Full-stack architecture** - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code


### Deep Native Integration
Valdi generates type-safe bindings between TypeScript and native platforms:
  * **Automatic code generation** - TypeScript interfaces compile to Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift bindings
  * **Native API access** - Direct access to platform APIs and third-party native libraries through polyglot modules
  * **Bidirectional communication** - Pass complex data structures and callbacks between TypeScript and native code safely
  * **Native protobuf support** - Seamless integration with protobuf for efficient data serialization


### Proven at Scale
  * Powers critical features in production Snap apps.
  * Supports advanced animations, real-time rendering, and complex gesture systems


### Feature Highlights
  * **Flexbox layout system** with automatic RTL support
  * **Worker threads** for multi-threaded JavaScript execution
  * **Native animations** for native look and feel
  * **Advanced gesture recognition** with platform-native handling
  * **Built-in testing framework** with component-level unit tests
  * **Bazel integration** for reproducible, incremental builds
